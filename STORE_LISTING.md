## Detailed Description

A browser extension that sorts tabs in the current window by title or URL.

## Features

### Sort by Title

Alphabetically sorts tabs by their page titles using standard locale-aware comparison.

### Sort by URL

Domain-aware sorting that groups tabs from the same website together. URLs are parsed and sorted by domain hierarchy (TLD, second-level domain, subdomains, then path). For example:

- `developers.google.com` and `mail.google.com` appear adjacent
- `github.com/user/repo1` and `github.com/user/repo2` are grouped together

### Keyboard Shortcuts

By default:

- Alt+Shift+T: Sort by title
- Alt+Shift+U: Sort by URL
- Customizable via chrome://extensions/shortcuts

### Settings

Default sort preference is saved and syncs across Chrome browsers when signed in.

## Privacy

The extension only stores your sort preference using Chrome's sync storage. No browsing data, page content, or usage analytics are collected or transmitted.
