## Extension Name

Organic Tab Sorter

## Short Description (132 characters max)

Sort browser tabs by title or URL with intelligent domain grouping. Preserves pinned tabs and tab groups.

## Detailed Description

Tired of hunting through dozens of browser tabs? Organic Tab Sorter helps you organize your tabs instantly with smart sorting that understands how websites are related.

### Key Features

**Two Sorting Modes:**

- Sort by Title: Alphabetically organize tabs by their page titles
- Sort by URL: Intelligent domain-aware sorting that groups related websites together

**Smart Domain Grouping:**
The URL sorting mode understands website structure and groups related sites intelligently. For example, dev.google.com and mail.google.com will appear next to each other because they share the same domain, not scattered across your tab bar.

**Lightning-Fast Keyboard Shortcuts:**

- Alt+Shift+T: Sort by title (instantly, without opening the popup)
- Alt+Shift+U: Sort by URL (instantly, without opening the popup)

**Preserves Your Tab Organization:**

- Pinned tabs stay pinned and at the beginning
- Tab groups remain intact and move to the left side
- Tabs within groups maintain their original order
- Only ungrouped tabs are sorted and reordered

**Persistent Settings:**
Save your preferred default sort mode, and it syncs across all your Chrome browsers when signed in.

### How It Works

Simply click the extension icon and choose "By Title" or "By URL" to instantly organize your tabs. Or use the keyboard shortcuts for even faster sorting without interrupting your workflow.

The domain-aware URL sorting is particularly powerful:

- <https://dev.google.com/products> → grouped with other Google domains
- <https://github.com/user/repo> → grouped with other GitHub URLs
- <https://docs.python.org/3/> → grouped with other Python documentation

This ensures sites from the same service stay together, making it easy to find what you need.

### Perfect For

- Developers juggling documentation, code repos, and development tools
- Researchers with multiple tabs from similar sources
- Anyone who regularly works with many browser tabs
- Power users who prefer keyboard shortcuts
- People who use tab groups to organize their work

### Privacy

Organic Tab Sorter respects your privacy:

- Only stores your sort preference locally
- Does NOT collect or transmit any browsing data
- Does NOT track which websites you visit
- Does NOT access page content
- No analytics, no tracking, no external servers
